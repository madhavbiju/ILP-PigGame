# Pig Game

The Pig Game is an interactive and entertaining two-player dice game that consists of two main parts: the Login Page and the Pig Game itself.

### How to Play

1. **Roll the Dice:** Players take turns rolling a six-sided die to accumulate points. Be cautious not to roll a 1, which resets your turn and causes you to lose your accumulated points.

2. **Hold Points:** At any time during your turn, you can choose to "Hold" to save your current turn's points and switch to the other player.

3. **Winning the Game:** The objective is to be the first player to reach or exceed the specified winning score, typically 100 points.
